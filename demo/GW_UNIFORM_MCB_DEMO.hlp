We illustrate minimum cycle basis of unweighted undirected graphs.

The edges of an arbitrary spanning tree used by the algorithm
are shown in red. Each edge has a label with a unique number.

As you edit the graph, a minimum cycle basis is indicated on
the standard output. Each cycle is represented by the unique numbers
of its edges.
