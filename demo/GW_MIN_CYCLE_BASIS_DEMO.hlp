We illustrate minimum cycle basis of graphs.

The edges of an arbitrary spanning tree used by the algorithm
are shown in red. The sliders allow you to change the edge costs.
Each edge has a label of the following form: unique number (cost).

As you edit the graph, a minimum cycle basis is indicated on
the standard output. Each cycle is represented by the unique numbers
of its edges.
