Minimum Cycle Basis Library
---------------------------

This package implements algorithms to compute Minimum 
Cycle Bases of weighted graphs.

For undirected graphs, two algorithms:

   - An O(m^3 + m n^2 \log n ) algorithm
   - An O( m^2 n^2 ) algorithm

For directed graphs:

   - An O(m^3 + m n^2 \log n ) Monte-Carlo algorithm
